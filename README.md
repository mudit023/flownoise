## What is Flownoise?
It's a productivity app that I made to make my life easier. You can use it to for your needs. Do you follow **pomodoro** technique? Then you'll love **flownoise**. I have added a timer with a bunch of useful features. And that's not it, if you like listening to ambient sound while working then **flownoise** got you covered. Flownoise has six different ambient sounds with separate volume control for each sound.

The feature that I love the most is its audio notifications🔊 Flownoise will notify you to take breaks, hydrate yourself, and also stretch your body. This can be very helpful when you are working for long hours.
